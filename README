    Requires PEAR HTTP_Request Library, http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request

    All functions return FALSE on failure, or on success, either:

        1      the command returned "success"
        array  an array containing the list returned from the command

    If a failure occurs, $this->errormsg will be set with the reason it failed.

USAGE

    require_once 'vitelity-api.inc';
    $v = new vitelityapi;
    $ratecenters = $v->listratecenters('VA');

EXTENSION

    This is how you would modify or extend the _log function in the 
    vitelityapi class.

        require_once 'vitelity-api.inc';
        require_once 'your_logging.inc';
        class vitelityapiextended extends vitelityapi {

            function _log($msg, $level='debug') {

                //  Log output to your own logging function.
                your_logging($level . '|' . $msg . "\n");

                //  If you want to get the default logging too, keep this line
                parent::_log($msg, $level);
            }
        }

ADMISSIONS

    The code works, but it is not very OO standardized, especially for PHP5.
    However, it does work, and there are no notices or warnings.  Maybe I'll
    rewrite it to be able to use the CURL library, or leave code in to allow
    for both.
